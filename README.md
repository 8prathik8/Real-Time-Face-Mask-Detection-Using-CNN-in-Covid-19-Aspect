# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN-in-Covid-19-Aspect
The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped everyone’s life as we know it.Many measures and proposals have been suggested to prevent the virus’s rapid spread since scientists detected it. In the midst of many of these, one major piece of advice was to “wear a mask!”. The mask or face coverings can protect the wearer from contracting the virus or spreading it to others. Hence, to ensure that the public is not wearing a mask, one of the applications I have developed is face mask detection, which uses biometrics to map the features of a human face, analyse the data, and determine whether the detected face is a positive image or a non-face or negative image by placing a box around it. The main ideology of studying and researching face mask detection is to use computer technology to directly mimic the action and manner of human facial features and develop a system that reduces the amount of effort required to identify whether or not the person is wearing a mask and notifying them with the assistance of the proposed model.

# Conclusion
As the world is suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic and technologies are blooming
with recent evolution, we have developed a novel solution for detecting whether a person
has a facemask on or not, which can surely contribute towards public wholesomeness.
Our modal can detect or monitor the people through IP cameras which can be considered
economically feasible. With the lockdown linked restrictions now being rolled back
gradually, the world is trying to return to its normalcy. According to WHO a face mask
with other preventive measures can help slow the spread of the virus. Our model can
be easily installed for automated monitoring. It can keep a track of people wearing face
masks at workplaces, which will help make them safer. Our proposed system detects a
face mask with an accuracy of 99.92%. We have used the latest architecture of CNN i.e.
MobileNetV2, the only architecture that can work on embedded devices. And also our
modal can successfully detect multiple faces at the same time.
